	
To install gnuplot-mode:

1. If you got gnuplot-mode from a release tarball, do the following
   at the command line:

      > ./configure
      > make

   If you're working from a git checkout of the gnuplot-mode
   repository, you will first need to do 

      > autoreconf
      > automake --add-missing

   before the "configure; make" step above.

   If you use XEmacs, add "EMACS=xemacs" to the "./configure" command.
   If you use Emacs.app on Mac OS X, add
   "EMACS=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs".
   You can also use the "--with-lispdir" option to select where you
   want to install the Elisp files.

   If "configure" doesn't work for you, the file "Makefile.dst" can be
   used.  In that case do, "make -f Makefile.dst".

2. Either run "make install", or move the .el and .elc files to a
   place where emacs can find them, for example
   /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp or your personal emacs directory.

3. Insert the contents of the `dotemacs' file into your .emacs file
   or system start-up file to enable gnuplot mode.

4. The function `gnuplot-info-lookup-symbol' looks at the Gnuplot
   info file that comes with this package or that can be made from
   the Gnuplot distribution.  For that function to work, the file
   gnuplot.info must be placed somewhere where info can find it, for
   example /usr/info.  A line like this in your .emacs allows you to
   put gnuplot.info any place convenient:
     (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/file")


The "configure; make" sequence may not work on all systems,
particularly Win32 systems.  The long-winded way of making the .elc
gpelcard.ps files is to edit each of the .el files with emacs and do
`M-x byte-compile-file'.  Then "latex gpelcard.tex" and
"dvips gpelcard.dvi".
